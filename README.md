This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python: a ZeroDivisionError that is not immediately obvious from a quick reading of the code. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` shows a simple and effective solution.  The issue is that the function doesn't explicitly handle a divide-by-zero exception in all cases.  This is more insidious than a simple divide-by-zero because it requires a more careful review of the function's logic. The solution involves adding exception handling to prevent the error.
